# 🛡️ AI-Powered Phishing Detector

This project is a lightweight desktop application designed to detect phishing messages using both a **locally trained AI model** and **OpenAI's GPT models**. Built with Python and Tkinter, the app provides fast, reliable predictions with insightful explanations using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations).

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- **Detects if a message is phishing or legitimate**
- Supports two modes:
  - ✅ **Local AI Model (Fast & Offline)**
  - 🌐 **ChatGPT (External, via OpenAI API)**
- Provides **clear explanation** of which words influenced the decision using LIME

---

## ✨ Main Features

- 🧠 **Dual AI Modes**: Local ML model and OpenAI GPT (3.5/4)
- 📊 **Confidence Breakdown**: Shows prediction percentage for phishing vs. legit
- 💡 **LIME Explanations**: Highlights which words influenced the result
- 🪄 **Simple GUI**: Clean, beginner-friendly interface built with Tkinter
- 🔐 **Offline Use**: Works locally without internet (except for GPT option)
